    "## Overview of the assertion audit tool\n",
    "\n",
    "The tool requires as input:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ audit-specific and contest-specific parameters, such as\n",
    "    - whether to sample with or without replacement\n",
    "    - the name of the risk function to use, and any parameters it requires\n",
    "    - a risk limit for each contest to be audited\n",
    "    - the social choice function for each contest, including the number of winners\n",
    "    - candidate identifiers\n",
    "+ a ballot manifest**\n",
    "+ a random seed\n",
    "+ a file of cast vote records\n",
    "+ reported results for each contest\n",
    "+ json files of assertions for IRV contests (one file per IRV contest)\n",
    "+ human reading of voter intent from the paper cards selected for audit\n",
    "\n",
    "** The ballot manifest could be only for cards purported to contain the\n",
    "contests under audit (manifest_type == \"STYLE\"), or could include cards that might not contain the\n",
    "contest (manifest_type == \"ALL\"). These are treated differently. If the sample is to be drawn only from cards that--according to the CVR--contain the contest, and a sampled card turns out not to\n",
    "contain the contest, that is considered a discrepancy, dealt with using the \"phantoms to zombies\" approach.\n",
    "It is assumed that every CVR corresponds to a card in the manifest, but there might\n",
    "be cards cast in the contest for which there is no corresponding CVR. In that case,\n",
    "phantom records are created to ensure that the audit is still truly risk-limiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an independent (i.e., not relying on the voting system) upper bound on the number of cards that contain the contest, if the number of CVRs that contain the contest does not exceed that bound, we can sample from paper purported to contain the contest and use the \"zombies\" approach (Banuelos & Stark) to deal with missing CVRs. This can greatly increase the efficiency of the audit if the contest is on only a small percentage of the cast cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any sampled phantom card (i.e., a card for which there are no CVRs) is treated as if its CVR is a non-vote (which it is), and as if its MVR was least favorable (a \"zombie\" producing the greatest doubt in every assertion, separately). Any sampled card for which\n",
    "there is a CVR is compared to its corresponding CVR. \n",
    "If the card turns out not to contain the contest (despite the fact that the CVR says it does), the MVR is treated in the least favorable way for each assertion (i.e., as a zombie rather than as a non-vote).\n",
    "\n",
    "The tool helps select cards for audit, and reports when the audit has found sufficiently strong evidence to stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tool exports a log of all the audit inputs except the CVR file, but including the auditors' manually determined voter intent from the audited cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current version uses a single sample to audit all contests. It is possible to refine things to target smaller contests."
